# Home_Automation_ESP32

This project makes use of database-controlled apps and controls the home appliances via Wi-Fi and using a mobile app. It also involves automatic water motor control and user-controlled speed of fan.
The deliverables will be in the form of an extension which will have 4 AC ports in which any AC appliances can be plugged, 2 of the ports(AC Lights) will have a simple on/off user defined input while the 3rd port (fan) will also have the variable user defined speed function. The 4th port will be for the water motor, it will monitor the water level and turn on and off automatically.


Advantages / Scope / Applications:
Along with serving the advantages of smart home, I aim to make my project portable in the form of an automated extension which can not only be used at home but also in office or any other place easily. This will give user the ease of access not only at home but also other places as well. This product form is very beneficial as we only need and AC source at a place on which the extension has to be plugged and we can extend the benefits of IOT to wherever we go without any additional wiring or circuitry
